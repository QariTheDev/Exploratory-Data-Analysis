# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
  Welcome to the Asia Cup Stats Exploratory Data Analysis project! In this project, we will be analyzing a dataset containing statistics from the Asia Cup, one of the most prestigious cricket tournaments in the world. The dataset includes information on the teams, players, and matches that have taken place in the tournament's history. Through this analysis, we will gain insights into the performance of the teams and players, as well as trends in the tournament over time. In this README, we will provide an overview of the dataset and the structure of the project, as well as a summary of the main findings from the analysis.
